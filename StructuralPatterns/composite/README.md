## Composite

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
The pattern has structural purpose and applies to objects.

### When to use

* you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
* you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects
