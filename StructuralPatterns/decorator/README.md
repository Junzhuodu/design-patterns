## Decorator

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators
provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
The pattern has structural purpose and applies to objects.

### When to use

* to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects
* for responsibilities that can be withdrawn
* when extension by subclassing is impractical
