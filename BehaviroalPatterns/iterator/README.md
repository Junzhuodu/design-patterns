## Iterator

Iterator pattern has behavioral purpose and applies to objects. The pattern provides 
a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing 
its underlying representation. 

### When to use

* to access an aggregate object's contents without exposing its internal representation
* to support multiple traversals of aggregate objects
* to provide a uniform interface for traversing different aggregate structures 
(to support polymorphic iteration)
