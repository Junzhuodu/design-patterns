Given a language, the pattern defines a represention for its grammar along with an
interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. 
The Interpreter pattern has behavioral purpose and applies to the classes.

### When to use

* when the grammar is simple (in case of complex grammars, there are better alternatives)
* efficiency is not a critical concern
