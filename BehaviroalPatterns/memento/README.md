## Memento

Memento without violating encapsulation, captures and externalizes an object's internal
state so that the object can be restored to this state later. The pattern has behavioral
purpose and applies to the objects.

### When to use

* a snapshot of an object's state must be saved so that it can be restored to that state later
* a direct interface to obtaining the state would expose implementation details and break the object's encapsulation
