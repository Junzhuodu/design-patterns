## C++ Design Patterns

C++ Implementation for 23 Design Patterns

#### Creational Patterns 
- [Abstract Factory], families of product objects
![image](./images/AbstractFactory.png)
- [Builder], how a composite object gets created
![image](./images/Builder.png)
- [Factory Method], subclass of object that is instantiated
![image](./images/Factory.png)
- [Prototype], class of object that is instantiated
![image](images/Prototype.png)
- [Singleton], the sole instance of a class 
![image](./images/SingletonPattern.png)
#### Structural Patterns
- [Adapter], interface to an object
![image](./images/Adapter.png)
- [Bridge], implementation of an object 
![image](./images/Bridge.png)
- [Composite], structure and composition of an object
![image](./images/Composite.png)
- [Decorator], responsibilities of an object without subclassing
![image](./images/Decorator.png)
- [Façade], interface to a subsystem
![image](./images/Facade.png)
- [Flyweight], storage costs of objects
![image](./images/Flyweight.png)
- [Proxy], how an object is accessed (its location)
![image](./images/Proxy.png)
#### Behavioral Patterns
- [Chain of Responsibility], object that can fulfill a request
![image](./images/ChainOfResponsibility.png)
- [Command], when and how a request is fulfilled
![image](./images/Command.PNG)
- [Interpreter], grammar and interpretation of a language
![image](./images/Interpreter.PNG)
- [Iterator], how an aggregate's elements are accessed
![image](./images/Iterator.png)
- [Mediator], how and which objects interact with each other
![image](./images/Mediator.PNG)
- [Memento], what private information is stored outside an object, and when 
![image](./images/Memento.PNG)
- [Observer], how the dependent objects stay up to date
![image](./images/Observer.PNG)
- [State], states of an object
![image](./images/State.PNG)
- [Strategy], an algorithm
![image](./images/Strategy.PNG)
- [Template Method], steps of an algorithm
![image](./images/TemplateMethod.png)
- [Visitor], operations that can be applied to objects without changing their classes
![image](./images/Visitor.PNG)
